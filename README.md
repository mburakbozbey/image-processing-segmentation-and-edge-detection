# Segmentation and edge detection examples

Following algorithms were implemented under Bogazici University's EE475-Image Processing course on Berkeley Segmentation Dataset **[1]** and all other images are in courtesy of Bogazici University:

1. K-means clustering with color features **[2]** and color + coordinate features
2. Seeded region growing on two images **[3]**
3. Edge detection on generated image with edge detector performance comparison **[4]**
4. Hough line detection on generated image
