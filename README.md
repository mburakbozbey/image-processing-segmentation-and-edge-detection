# Segmentation and edge detection examples

Following algorithms were implemented under Bogazici University's EE475-Image Processing course on Berkeley Segmentation Dataset **[1]** and all other images are in courtesy of Bogazici University:

**1.** K-means clustering with color features **[2]** and color + coordinate features
